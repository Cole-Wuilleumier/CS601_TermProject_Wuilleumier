I moved out west from Rhode Island a year ago for the job. Since then, I have been exploring the greater Tahoe/Reno area and taking in the sights and scenes of the American West.</p>

                    <h2>My Job</h2>
                    <p>I am very lucky to have a fulfilling job that I enjoy. My company is responsible for the sales and distribution of Jones, Yes, and Now snowboards in the <abbr title="United States of America">US</abbr> and Canada. Since joining the company, snowboarding has become a big part of my life. One of the benefits of working for a snowboard company is that we get “ride breaks”, during which we get to leave the office to go to one of our many local ski resorts to snowboard, including world famous Palisades Tahoe.</p>

                    <p>I am very proud of the work that our company does, especially the work for Jones. Jones Snowboards was founded by legendary big mountain snowboarder, Jeremy Jones. The company was founded with sustainability as one of its core principles. Working on projects that help makes the company more sustainable makes my job very rewarding.</p>
