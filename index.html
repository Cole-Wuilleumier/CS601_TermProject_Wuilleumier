I am originally from southern Massachusetts, and I have spent the last few years living in Providence, RI. Since 2018, I have been taking classes at Boston University in the Master of Science in Software Development program. Throughout the program I have learn so much about software development and project management, but I am happy to say that this is my last course in the program before I graduate.</p>

                    <h2>Health/Fitness</h2>
                    <p>When I am not chipping away at homework, you can find me snowboarding, skateboarding, mountain biking, kayaking, cycling, or hiking somewhere in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Since moving to Truckee, I have begun taking my health and fitness very seriously. I recently bought a fitness tracking watch (<a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/679335" target="_blank">Garmin Instinct Solar</a>) for athletic training. Using the features on this watch I can better understand how my body responds to exercise and stress. You can learn more about my health/fitness data on the <a href="./fitness.html" >fitness page</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Photos and Travel</h2>
                    <p>Another thing that I love to do is travel. Over the last year I have done more traveling than I have done in my entire life. June 2021, I took a road trip from Massachusetts to my new home in California. Since then, I have gone to Seattle, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. Check out some of my travel pictures on the <a href="./photos.html">photos page</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Music</h2>
                   <p>Music has always been a big part of my life. Growing up I used to form bands and write music with my friends. Early in my undergrads career I started a band called “Kid Mountain”. We have been playing together since 2011 and we are still writing music together to this day.

                    <h2>Work</h2>
                   <p>I am very lucky to have a job that I love. I work as a Director of Operations in the sporting goods industry. The company I work for distributes snowboards for the Jones, Yes, and Now snowboard brands to the United States and Canada.
