# CS601_TermProject_Wuilleumier
This repository contains the code for CS601 Term Project.

## Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to demostrate the web development skills that I have learn in CS601.
This project utilizes the following:
- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid Templates
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Vue.js 2.0

## Website Content
The focus of the website content is myself (Cole Wuilleumier). 

### Homepage
This is a introduction page that describes my interests/hobbies/job roles. It links to different portions of the site.

### Fitness
This page utilizes Vue.js to fetch data from a live server. The data was collected using my Garmin watch and is hosted on a live server that I setup myself for this project.
Check out the Server repository at this using this URL: https://github.com/Cole-Wuilleumier/METCS601_final_server

### Photos
This page utilizes Vue.js 2 to display a photo gallery. The user is able to navigate through the photo gallery using the buttons on the page.

### Music
This page utlizes Vue.js 2 to display a simple photo gallery. It also uses embedded Spotify players to allow visitors to listen to the music directly from the page.

### Contact
This page hosts a contact form built with HTML. User inputs are validated using JavaScript to ensure that inputs are formatted correctly.
*Please note: This form does not actually post to a server. This was intentional for demostration purposes.

### Resume
This page hosts a simple resume page that utilizes the CSS grid.

*All HTML/CSS passed code validation except for the portions of HTML that contained Vue.js attributes.
